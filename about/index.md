About me
--------
I am Salander, a QA engineer works in [Dell Technologies][dell].

I picked Salander as my English name from a movie: [The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo][tgwtdt] because I'm a such movie fan. 
Besides, one of my dream was to be a brilliant hacker just like "THE SALANDER" in the movie.
But truth is I am just a mediocre Java coder and someone like "THE SALANDER" never exists in reality as far as I know.
Even so, I'm willing to learn not only Java programming skills but also information security knowledge.

About this site
---------------
This is my first blog to record and summarize my learning about professional skills and knowledge.
I built this github page from a template from [Chen-Pang He][cph] and I will try to customize it little by little.
As for the language, if you ask me "Why English?", I would say that I feel English font looks more artistic with this jekyll theme ( Ha Ha Ha ).
